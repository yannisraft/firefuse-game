Game Title: Firework Fusion
Core Concept
A skill-based timing game where the player launches different fireworks and creates "Fusion Combos" by making their explosions overlap in the sky, aiming for the highest score within a time limit.

Player Objective
Score as many points as possible in 60 seconds by strategically launching fireworks to create spectacular combos.

Gameplay Mechanics
1. The Ignition Pad
At the bottom of the screen, there are 6 distinct, colored buttons (e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple, Orange).

Each button is tied to a unique firework (different color, explosion shape, and sound).

Global Cooldown: After pressing any button, all buttons become unusable for 1 second. This prevents spamming and forces the player to be deliberate. The buttons could have a visual timer (like a grey overlay that swipes away) to show when they are ready again.

2. The Fireworks
When a button is pressed:

A rocket of the corresponding color launches from the bottom of the screen.

The rocket travels for 1.5 seconds to a semi-random position in the upper half of the screen.

After 1.5 seconds, it explodes.

Here's a sample set of fireworks:

Button Color	Explosion Shape	Points
Red	Standard Spherical Burst	10
Blue	Crackling "Crossette" (4 small bursts)	10
Green	Weeping Willow (long, droopy trails)	10
Yellow	Ring Shell (expands in a circle)	10
Purple	Peony (dense sphere of stars)	10
Orange	Fountain (sparks shoot up/out)	10

3. The "Fusion" Combo System (The Core Mechanic)
This is where the skill comes in.

When a firework explodes, its "blast radius" (an invisible circle) persists for a very short time, about 0.5 seconds.

Fusion Combo: If a new firework explodes while its center is inside the blast radius of a previous firework, a Fusion Combo is triggered!

Reward:

A special, multi-colored, and much larger firework (e.g., a "Brocade Crown with Pistil") explodes at the point of the combo.

A satisfying "chime" or "power-up" sound plays.

The player earns a significant point bonus: +100 Points.

Visual text like "FUSION!" appears on the screen.

4. Advanced Combos
To reward expert players, you can add more depth:

Double Fusion: If your combo explosion's blast radius is then overlapped by a third firework, it triggers a "Double Fusion". This could be a massive, screen-filling firework. +300 Points!

Chain Reaction: A Double Fusion could have a larger blast radius, making it easier to chain into a fourth firework, and so on.

Game Flow
Start Screen: Shows "Firework Fusion", a "Play" button, and maybe the high score.

Game: The player clicks "Play". A timer starts from 60 seconds.

Action: The player clicks the ignition buttons, trying to time the 1.5-second rocket travel to make the explosions overlap.

Scoring: The score updates in real-time at the top of the screen.

End Game: When the timer hits zero, the fireworks show a grand finale, and the final score is displayed.

Result: The player sees their score, the high score, and is given options to "Play Again" or "Share on X.com".

Why This Idea is Great
Simple Controls: Just 6 buttons and clicking. Very easy to understand.

High Skill Ceiling: It's easy to play, but hard to master. Players will be driven to perfect their timing to get huge combo scores.

Visually Rewarding: The core goal of the game is to create beautiful visuals. Every action, especially a successful combo, has a spectacular payoff.

Perfect for Social: The combination of a high-score chase and stunning visuals makes it highly shareable. A post on X.com saying "I scored 1,250 in Firework Fusion! Can you beat me?" with a link to the game is very compelling.

This concept takes your idea and builds it into a complete, engaging, and highly replayable game loop. We can start developing this right away!
